A significant severe weather episode occurred across north Texas during the evening hours of May 8th.  Severe thunderstorms developed between Abilene and Childress along a dryline late in the afternoon and moved east into north Texas.  The most severe weather occurred along a corridor roughly along and 40 miles to the south of US 380 from west of Throckmorton in Throckmorton County eastward to Greenville in Hunt County.  Occasionally propagating in a train echo fashion, these storms were efficient hail and wind producers.  Wise County was hardest hit by severe weather on the 8th, with wind, hail, and one confirmed tornado destroying 15 houses and damaging 178 others.  Widespread damage to automobiles and trees also were reported.  In Denton County, thunderstorm winds blew down powerlines across Interstate 35-E near Lake Dallas, closing both northbound and southbound lanes of traffic.  In the ensuing traffic jam, motorists were stranded in their vehicles as another severe thunderstorm moved across the area.

Storms redeveloped over north central Texas during the early afternoon March 2, moving east northeast across the area. At least four storms developed in sequence, each a little south of the previous one, and each with a little longer track.

The first storm developed over southwest Jack county shortly before 1400 CST, decreasing near Bridgeport shortly after 1500 CST. A second storm developed near Possum Kingdom Reservoir (northwest Palo Pinto county around 1440 CST, moving across southern Jack county to near Decatur around 1550 CST, and decreasing over northwest Denton county shortly after 1600 CST. A third storm developed west of Mineral Wells (Palo Pinto county) shortly after 1500 CST, moving across northern Parker, southeast Wise, and southern Denton counties before decreasing over northwest Collin county shortly around 1800 CST. A fourth storm developed near Mineral Wells around 1630 CST, moving parallel and just a little south of the third storm, but continuing over northern Hunt county, and decreasing over Delta county around 2000 CST.

				Tarrant County Thunderstorm Narrative
				

The first tornado damage was reported near Castleberry High School, about four miles west of downtown Fort Worth (618 PM). Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 

	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 

	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20. The tornado then struck the northern part of Arlington Airport (F2). The tornado paralled I-20, crossing the Interstate about one mile west of Highway 360, overturning at least one 18-wheeler (F1)(712 PM). The tornado then began moving northeast, ending with F2 damage to subdivision just northeast of Grand Prairie airport (near Arkansas and Parkside)(720 PM). In spite of the damage, there were no deaths or serious injuries in Arlington or Grand Prairie.

	One commercial building was destroyed in Arlington, and 22 others damaged. Residential building damage (Tarrant county) was as follows:

				Tarrant County Thunderstorm Narrative
				

The first tornado damage was reported near Castleberry High School, about four miles west of downtown Fort Worth (618 PM). Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 

	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 

	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20. The tornado then struck the northern part of Arlington Airport (F2). The tornado paralled I-20, crossing the Interstate about one mile west of Highway 360, overturning at least one 18-wheeler (F1)(712 PM). The tornado then began moving northeast, ending with F2 damage to subdivision just northeast of Grand Prairie airport (near Arkansas and Parkside)(720 PM). In spite of the damage, there were no deaths or serious injuries in Arlington or Grand Prairie.

	One commercial building was destroyed in Arlington, and 22 others damaged. Residential building damage (Tarrant county) was as follows:
